# football-logo-detector

I have implemented football club logo detector using TensorFlow object detection API. For proof of concept, the solution was limited to four clubs:
1. Real Madrid
2. Manchester United
3. Chelsea
4. Barcelona

The process was initiated with preparing data. Images from each club were googled and downloaded in abtches using Fatkun batch downlading extension by Chrome. Then they were anually labelled in PASCAL VOC format using Labelimg graphical image annotation tool:
